🧾 Task: Build an  simple client-side authentication system   پ(Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind) + shadcn Library
🚀 Goal

Implement a login flow with two pages:




📱 Login page with mobile number input (Iran format only) + "Login" button




🏠 Dashboard page that welcomes the user





📋 Details
🔑 Login Page


📝 Form with a single input for Iranian mobile numbers




✅ Client-side validation required (valid formats:




09xxxxxxxxx




+989xxxxxxxxx




00989xxxxxxxxx

)






▶️ On "Login" button click:




🔗 Send GET request → https://randomuser.me/api/?results=1&nat=us




📥 Retrieve user data (name, email, picture) → store in localStorage




🔀 Redirect → Dashboard page






🖥️ Dashboard Page


👋 Show welcome message with user’s name




🚪 Logout button → clears localStorage + redirects to Login page




🔒 If no user data in localStorage → redirect to Login page





🎨 UI Components (Tailwind)


✍️ Input: label, error state, focus style, validation




🔘 Button: primary, disabled, loading states





⚙️ Technical Requirements


⚛️ Next.js App Router + TypeScript




🎨 Styling → Tailwind CSS only




📂 Clean, modular folder structure (UI components, lib for utils)




📱 Responsive design (mobile-first)




📐 Next.js best practices (layout, metadata, client components)




💾 User state/session → handled client-side with localStorage





🌟 Quality Expectations


🧹 Clean & readable code




🔤 Clear & consistent naming conventions




♿ Accessibility (ARIA attributes, focus-visible states)




💬 Concise comments where needed




📘 README with setup + run instructions





🔄 Flow


👤 User opens Login page → enters valid Iranian phone → clicks Login




🌐 API called → data saved in localStorage → redirect to Dashboard




🙌 Dashboard shows Welcome + user’s name




🚪 Logout → clear storage → redirect back to Login





🔍 Evaluation Criteria


✨ Code Quality → clean, modular, maintainable




🧑‍💻 TypeScript Usage → strong types, no any




🎨 UI/UX → responsive, clean Tailwind design




🔧 Logic → validation, API handling, redirect, auth state




📈 Scalability → reusable components & structure
